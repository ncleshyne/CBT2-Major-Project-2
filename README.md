# WRECKLAMO APP
#### A site for complaints

### Introduction
This app/website is the final project of Term 2 in the Vivixx Coding Bootcamp. Our instructor grouped us into two. My partner was [@deazee101](https://github.com/deazee101).
It took a week of planning, coding and designing. It was pitched in front of investors on Aug 17 2017.

### Idea
Wrecklamo from the word "Wreck" and the Filipino word "Reklamo" (which means complaint), aims to provide anonymity to users who post complaints online. It was designed just like the common social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter; wherein users can post images, comment, customize their profiles and such. The one thing that separates this site from the majority is that its sole purpose is for posting complaints.
